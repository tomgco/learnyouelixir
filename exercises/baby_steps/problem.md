Write a program that prints the text "HELLO WORLD" to the console (stdout).

----------------------------------------------------------------------
## HINTS

To make an Elixir program, create a new file with a `.exs` extension and start writing Elixir! Execute your program by running it with the
`elixir` command. e.g.:

```sh
$ elixir program.exs
```

You can write to the console using the IO module http://elixir-lang.org/docs/stable/elixir/ :

```
IO.write "Test"
```

When you are done, you must run:

```sh
$ {appname} verify program.exs
```

to proceed. Your program will be tested, a report will be generated, and the lesson will be marked 'completed' if you are successful.
